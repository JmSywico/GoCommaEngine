/*
 * Bungee Force Generator
 *
 * This class makes a particle behave like it's attached to a real bungee cord.
 * The particle moves freely until it stretches the bungee past its rest length.
 * When stretched, the bungee pulls the particle back toward the anchor with a force
 * that gets stronger the more it is stretched. No force is applied if the bungee is slack.
 * This creates a springy, bouncing motion just like a real bungee cord.
 *
 * - No force if the particle is within the rest length (bungee is slack).
 * - Force pulls back only when stretched, and is stronger the more it stretches.
 * - Different from a chain, which just stops the particle at a max length.
