/*
 * Chain Constraint
 *
 * This class makes a particle act like it's attached to a chain.
 * The chain lets the particle move freely until it reaches the max length.
 * If the particle tries to go farther, it gets pushed back as if hitting the end of a real chain.
 * The restitution value controls how much it bounces when this happens.
 *
 * - No effect if the chain is slack (within max length).
 * - If stretched too far, the particle is pushed back and may bounce.
